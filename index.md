## Why AGE Forge?

[Apache AGE](https://age.apache.org/) is a PostgreSQL extension that adds graph database capabilities, combining the power of graphs with the reliability of PostgreSQL. However, the ecosystem around AGE is still maturing.

**AGE Forge** aims to fill this gap by providing:

- **Production-ready tools** like ORMs and client libraries
- **Honest benchmarks** comparing AGE with alternatives
- **Community resources** to help developers adopt AGE

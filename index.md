## Why AGE Forge?

[Apache AGE](https://age.apache.org/) is a PostgreSQL extension that adds graph database capabilities. If your project already uses PostgreSQL, AGE lets you add graph features **without introducing a separate database**:

- **Zero operational overhead** - Same backups, same monitoring, same connection pooling
- **ACID transactions** across both relational and graph data
- **Hybrid queries** - Combine SQL and Cypher in a single query
- **Leverage existing skills** - Your team already knows PostgreSQL

However, the AGE ecosystem is still maturing. **AGE Forge** fills this gap by providing production-ready tools, honest benchmarks, and community resources to help developers adopt AGE with confidence.

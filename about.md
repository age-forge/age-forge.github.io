# About AGE Forge

AGE Forge is a community initiative to build tools, resources, and libraries for the [Apache AGE](https://age.apache.org/) ecosystem.

## Mission

Make Apache AGE a first-class choice for graph database applications by providing:

- Production-ready tools (ORMs, client libraries)
- Honest, reproducible benchmarks
- Quality documentation and tutorials
- Active community support

## Why AGE?

Apache AGE brings graph database capabilities to PostgreSQL:

- **Open Source** - Apache 2.0 license, no vendor lock-in
- **PostgreSQL Foundation** - ACID transactions, mature tooling, proven reliability
- **Cypher Support** - Industry-standard graph query language
- **Hybrid Queries** - Combine graph traversals with SQL in the same database

## Background

This project started from practical need. After creating [arango-orm](https://github.com/kashifpk/arango-orm) for ArangoDB, concerns about licensing led to exploring alternatives. Apache AGE emerged as the most promising open-source option.

Rather than just switching, we decided to:
1. **Benchmark fairly** - Understand where AGE excels and where it needs work
2. **Build tools** - Create the libraries developers need
3. **Share openly** - Document findings for the community
